# docusaurus-tutorial

Docusaurus makes it easy to maintain Open Source documentation websites
1. Run `cd website` to go into the website directory.
2. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
3. A browser window will open up at `http://localhost:3000`

Congratulations, we have just made our first Docusaurus site!
